## üß† What It Does

For any given stock ticker (e.g. `AAPL`, `MSFT`, `NVDA`), this app:
- Pulls last 5 trading-day prices (mocked)
- Calculates a simple momentum score
- (Mock) fetches 5 latest news headlines
- Generates a "pulse": bullish / bearish / neutral
- Gives a short LLM-like explanation
- Returns a JSON response via REST API

Design Trade-offs
Used mocked data instead of real APIs to skip authentication delays.

Used Gemini-style static responses for LLM reasoning due to key constraints.

Focused on core logic, minimal design polish.
